## About Me 
I have worked as a machine learning research scientist for the last 13 years on various projects involving: computer vision, natural language processing, transfer learning, knowledge distillation, evolutionary algorithms and AI on embedded systems. I have a PhD in computer science with a focus on computer vision and scene understanding.
